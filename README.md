# 🚧 Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to extract key insights and visualize trends related to accident severity, vehicle type, road conditions, and time of occurrence. The final output is a fully interactive dashboard providing data-driven support for policy recommendations and road safety improvements.

## 🧭 Objective

The main objective is to analyze the **total number of casualties** from road accidents and explore different dimensions such as accident severity, vehicle type, road surface, and time of day. The insights are presented through a detailed dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### ✅ Primary KPIs:
- Total **Casualties** reported after accidents.
- Total Casualties **by Accident Severity** and their **percentage** contribution.
- Maximum Casualties **by Vehicle Type**.

### ✅ Secondary KPIs:
- Total Casualties **by Vehicle Type**.
- **Monthly trend** comparison of casualties (Current Year vs Previous Year).
- **Maximum Casualties by Road Type**.
- Casualties **distribution by Road Surface** condition.
- **Day/Night** and **Location/Area-wise** relationship with total casualties.
